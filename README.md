# Location Simulator

## Project overview

This project contains the source code and documentation for the _Location Simulator_ app, an Android application for training of USAR personnel.

Using _Location Simulator_, personnel can be trained in the operation of acoustic location equiment for the search and rescue of persons from collapsed structures. This is accomplished by placing an Android smartphone into a rubble structure. The phone will periodically vibrate using the vibration motor and/or generate audible signals from audio recording, so that the personnel being trained can precisely locate the phone within the structure. This app can thus replace existing training aids such as automatic "knocking devices" or cell phones numbers being dialled by the trainers.
