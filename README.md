# Location Simulator

## Project overview

This project contains the source code and documentation for the _Location Simulator_ app, an Android application for training of Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) personnel.

Using _Location Simulator_, personnel can be trained in the operation of acoustic location equiment for the search and rescue of persons from collapsed structures. This is accomplished by placing an Android smartphone into a rubble structure. The phone will periodically vibrate using the vibration motor and/or generate audible signals from audio recording, so that personnel being trained can precisely locate the phone within the structure. This app can thus replace existing training aids such as automatic "knocking devices" or cell phones numbers being dialled by the trainers.

The app was developed as a student project at the University of Luebeck, Germany, in collaboration with volunteers in the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief (the THW). The continued principal development of the app was handed over to one of these volunteers. However, the THW is not otherwise affiliated with the development of this app.
